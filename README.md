# blender-default-addons-dir
Change the default blender addon directory to be the "user" addon directory. Single-file addon, just copy the .py into your addons directory.

This is handy because multiple versions of blender can all share the same addon directory as set in prefs. You don't actually need this addon to do that, but it will default to using the "Default" directory (which is the version-specific one), and I always forgot to change the setting to 'User Prefs' in the addon install dialog. This just changes to use the user directory as the default, you still have the option to switch it back to 'Default'.
